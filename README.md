# View_finder

To do:
- once the list of polygon coordinates are made, use the elevation along path to make more points between the angle endpoints with elevation data
  - this will allow the polygon lines to be displayed properly over the terrain
- Make more points between initial coordinates and what is now iteration 1
- continue on the task of masking not-visable points between initial coordinates and horizon.
  - The height_at() function should be able to work on an angle lower than initial elevation
